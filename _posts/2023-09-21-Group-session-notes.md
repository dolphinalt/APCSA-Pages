## Ethan Tran

Make sure you know what extend is in classes. FRQ 3 requires this!

FRQs are pretty simple, just do the requirements

## Raymond

Know how to get and use methods from packages (such as randnum)

College board uses math.random(), but this returns a float, so you have to cast it to an int

Reordering for loops is necessary and is a common issue

Iteration presents possible time complexity issues

using i and j for for loops can get confusing, use something like row and column
