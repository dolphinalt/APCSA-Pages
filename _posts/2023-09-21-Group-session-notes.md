# EATER

## Tay



## Ethan Tran

Make sure you know what extend is in classes. FRQ 3 requires this!

FRQs are pretty simple, just do the requirements

## Raymond

Know how to get and use methods from packages (such as randnum)

College board uses math.random(), but this returns a float, so you have to cast it to an int

Reordering for loops is necessary and is a common issue

Iteration presents possible time complexity issues

using i and j for for loops can get confusing, use something like row and column

## Anthony

Make good use of builtin methods in Java

# A-REEL

## Emma

Think of a class as a blueprint for something

A lot of MC that focus on which params to put into classes

Recognize what class you need to make

The table is very useful!

superconstructors need to be used, learn what they are

## Ekam

Understand all the info given to you from the question!

Understand datatypes

College board iterates through arrays backwards?? --> Deleting forwards shrinks list, backwards required for no shrinkage

Go back and refer to the question while doing it (no extra lists/vars allowed)

Make inferences about situation through the data

## Ranauk

- 2015 Q4
- Good understanding of how for looks work
- Good descriptions of his answers
- Really good diagram for explaining how the contains method works
