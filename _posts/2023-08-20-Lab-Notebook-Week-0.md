# Welcome to CSA!
First day in APCSA! I'm excited to learn more about computer science and programming and hopefully I am able to apply the things I learn to the next USACO competition in December.

## Linux Shell
Setting up a linux shell was pretty easy, as 90% of work was carried over from APCSP. Something interesting that happened though was that my makefile was actually working, while on all non-macbooks didn't work. They had to resort to using a shell script version of the makefile.

## Build a Project
I created a calculator inspired by the apple iphone calculator app. It was pretty simple, just putting text on the screen and running an evaluation statement on that string. I also peer programed a snake game with Alex Lu, which you will find more detail about in his lab notebook.
