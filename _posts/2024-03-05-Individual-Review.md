## **Exceptional achievement**

I did not get a 93% or higher last trimester, but this was due to a low score on the N@TM assignment. I asked for late credit on this assignment, and was told I would get it, but it was never given to me. With a 76% or higher on that assignment, I am above a 93, and I think I deserve the late credit, pushing me past the 93% mark.

## **Individual Progress**

I have individually been making progress on AP material, and this can be seen from my FRQ writeups:

[FRQ 1](https://dolphinalt.github.io/APCSA-Pages/posts/2015-CSA-FRQ-Q1_IPYNB_2_/)

[FRQ 2](https://dolphinalt.github.io/APCSA-Pages/posts/2015-CSA-FRQ-Q2_IPYNB_2_/)

[FRQ 3](https://dolphinalt.github.io/APCSA-Pages/posts/2015-CSA-FRQ-Q3_IPYNB_2_/)

[FRQ 4](https://dolphinalt.github.io/APCSA-Pages/posts/2015-CSA-FRQ-Q4_IPYNB_2_/)

I have also been going through the AP College Board Videos, as well as reviewing the previous lessons about AP topics from the class.

Taking a look at my key commits, here are a few commits regarding the stock database:

## **GitHub Pages Blog**

As can be seen above, my blog is complete and well made. I also been going around to get feedback on my FRQs with my team members to solicit feedback and improve my work.
