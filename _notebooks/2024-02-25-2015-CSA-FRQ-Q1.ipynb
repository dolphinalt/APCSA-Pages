    "**Directions:** SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.\n",

    "**Notes:**\n",
    " \n",
    " - Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    " - In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves reasoning about one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays of integers. You will write three static methods, all of which are in a single enclosing class, named DiverseArray (not shown). The first method returns the sum of the values of a one-dimensional array; the second method returns an array that represents the sums of the rows of a two-dimensional array; and the third method analyzes row sums.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Write a static method arraySum that calculates and returns the sum of the entries in a specified one-dimensional array. The following example shows an array arr1 and the value returned by a call to arraySum.\n",
    "\n",
    "A table is shown with two columns, arr 1 on the left and Value returned by arraySum open parentheses arr 1 close parentheses. In the left column an array is shown. It is a horizontal row of 5 boxes with the numbers 0 through 4 above the boxes from left to right. The boxes read 1, 3, 2, 7, and 3. In the right column is the value 16.\n",
