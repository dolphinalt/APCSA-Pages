    "**Directions:** SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.\n",

    "Notes:\n",
    " \n",
    " - Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    " - In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This question involves the design of an interface, writing a class that implements the interface, and writing a method that uses the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) A number group represents a group of integers defined in some way. It could be empty, or it could contain one or more integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an interface named NumberGroup that represents a group of integers. The interface should have a single contains method that determines if a given integer is in the group. For example, if group1 is of type NumberGroup, and it contains only the two numbers -5 and 3, then group1.contains(-5) would return true, and group1.contains(2) would return false.\n",
    "Write the complete NumberGroup interface. It must have exactly one method."
